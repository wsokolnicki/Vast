# Vast
Board Game Project

Vast the crystal cavern is one of the newest games, which I fell in love in. I came up with an idea to transfer it into a PC, when I found a pdf file with all of the components, required for game to be playable.

First update:
- Clicking on the board will zoom in and stop the camera just above it (still requires some work). Press anywhere off the board to return to main view.
- While zoomed in, clicking RMB will enlarge the text, that was chosen and then pressing LMB will cancel that.

All of the above, works only on Knight Board, for know.
